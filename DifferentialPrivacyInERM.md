# Differentially Private Empirical Risk Minimization
Kamalika Chaudhuri, Claire Monteleoni, Anand D. Sarwate

## Important points from paper
- **Sensitivity** : Max difference between value functions when one input changes ( S(g) ) 
- **Output based noise** : Add noise to the output $g(z_1, .. z_n) + \neta$, where $\neta$ is laplacian function with std. dev. as $S(g)/\eta$
